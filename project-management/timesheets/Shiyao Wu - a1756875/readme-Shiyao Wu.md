# Github Contribution
## Early Development Phase

Developed the student timesheet submission interface. Code is stored in the team's GitHub repository (path: https://github.cs.adelaide.edu.au/MCI-Projects-2024/Team-25/blob/main/src/app/students).

Implemented the student timesheet submission page with features such as date selection, time selection, task description, and time calculation.

Created and implemented the TimesheetForm.jsx components. Code is stored in the GitHub repository (paths: https://github.cs.adelaide.edu.au/MCI-Projects-2024/Team-25/blob/main/src/components/TimesheetForm.jsx).

## Mid Development Phase

Developed and implemented the student information import functionality on the teacher's side. By reading CSV files, student data was stored in the database and displayed in the front-end table. Code is stored in the GitHub repository (path: https://github.cs.adelaide.edu.au/MCI-Projects-2024/Team-25/blob/main/src/app/staff/import).

Participated in designing and implementing the database logic for storing student data. Code is stored in the GitHub repository (path: https://github.cs.adelaide.edu.au/MCI-Projects-2024/Team-25/blob/main/src/database/student.js).

Created and implemented the CsvUpload.jsx component. Code is stored in the GitHub repository (path: https://github.cs.adelaide.edu.au/MCI-Projects-2024/Team-25/blob/main/src/components/CsvUpload.jsx).

## Late Development Phase

Designed and implemented the semester setup page on the teacher's side, allowing teachers to set the start date of the semester and the mid-term break, ensuring the front-end timesheet interface automatically reads and applies these settings. Code is stored in the GitHub repository (path: https://github.cs.adelaide.edu.au/MCI-Projects-2024/Team-25/blob/main/src/app/staff/time).

Participated in designing and implementing database operations and backend logic for seamless front-end and back-end communication, ensuring accurate data transmission and processing. Relevant code is stored in the GitHub repository (path: https://github.cs.adelaide.edu.au/MCI-Projects-2024/Team-25/blob/main/src/database/save-semester-info.js).

Created and implemented the TimeSetup.jsx component. Code is stored in the GitHub repository (path: https://github.cs.adelaide.edu.au/MCI-Projects-2024/Team-25/blob/main/src/components/TimeSetup.jsx).
